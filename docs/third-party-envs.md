## <a name="AWSAMI"></a>Generating a Malcolm Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Use on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This section outlines the process of using [packer](https://www.packer.io/)'s [Amazon AMI Builder](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/amazon) to create an [EBS-backed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/amazon/ebs) Malcolm AMI for either the x86-64 or arm64 CPU architecture. This section assumes you have good working knowledge of [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html).

### <a name="AWSAMIPrerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

* [packer](https://www.packer.io/)
    - the packer command-line tool ([download](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/downloads))
* [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
    - the AWS Command Line Interface with functioning access to your AWS infrastructure
* AWS access key ID and secret access key
    - [AWS security credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html)
* ensure the AWS account you are using for packer has minimal required permissions
    - [Amazon AMI builder](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/amazon)

The files referenced in this section can be found in [scripts/third-party-environments/aws/ami]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/scripts/third-party-environments/aws/ami).

1. Copy `packer_vars.json.example` to `packer_vars.json`
    ```bash
    $ cp ./packer_vars.json.example ./packer_vars.json
    ```
1. Edit `packer_vars.json` 
    * set `aws_access_key`, `aws_secret_key`, `vpc_region`, `instance_arch`, and other variables as needed
1. Validate the packer configuration
    ```bash
    $ packer validate packer_build.json
    The configuration is valid.
    ```
1. Launch packer to build the AMI
    ```bash
    $ packer build -var-file=packer_vars.json packer_build.json

    amazon-ebs: output will be in this color.

    ==> amazon-ebs: Prevalidating any provided VPC information
    ==> amazon-ebs: Prevalidating AMI Name: malcolm-v{{ site.malcolm.version }}-x86_64-2024-10-10T15-41-32Z
        amazon-ebs: Found Image ID: ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    ...

    ==> amazon-ebs: Waiting for AMI to become ready...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Skipping Enable AMI deprecation...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Adding tags to AMI (ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Tagging snapshot: snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ==> amazon-ebs: Creating AMI tags
        amazon-ebs: Adding tag: "Malcolm": "idaholab/Malcolm/v{{ site.malcolm.version }}"
        amazon-ebs: Adding tag: "source_ami_name": "al2023-ami-ecs-hvm-2023.0.20241003-kernel-6.1-x86_64"
    ==> amazon-ebs: Creating snapshot tags
    ==> amazon-ebs: Terminating the source AWS instance...
    ==> amazon-ebs: Cleaning up any extra volumes...
    ==> amazon-ebs: No volumes to clean up, skipping
    ==> amazon-ebs: Deleting temporary keypair...
    Build 'amazon-ebs' finished after 19 minutes 57 seconds.

    ==> Wait completed after 19 minutes 57 seconds

    ==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
    --> amazon-ebs: AMIs were created:
    us-east-1: ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
1. Use `aws` (or the [Amazon EC2 console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home)) to verify that the new AMI exists
    ```bash
    $ aws ec2 describe-images --owners self --filters "Name=root-device-type,Values=ebs" --filters "Name=name,Values=malcolm-*"
    ```
    ```json

        ]
    }
    ```
1. Launch an instance from the new AMI
    * for x86-64 instances `c4.4xlarge`, `t2.2xlarge`, and `t3a.2xlarge` seem to be good instance types for Malcolm
    * for arm64 instances, `m6gd.2xlarge`, `m6g.2xlarge`, `m7g.2xlarge`, and `t4g.2xlarge` seem to be good instance types for Malcolm
    * see [recommended system requirements](system-requirements.md#SystemRequirements) for Malcolm
1. SSH into the instance
1. Run `~/Malcolm/scripts/configure` to configure Malcolm
1. Run `~/Malcolm/scripts/auth_setup` to set up authentication for Malcolm
1. Run `~/Malcolm/scripts/start` to start Malcolm
