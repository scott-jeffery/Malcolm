# <a name="PCAP"></a>PCAP processors

When a PCAP is uploaded (either through Malcolm's [upload web interface](upload.md#Upload) or just copied manually into the `./pcap/upload` directory), the `pcap-monitor` container has a script that picks up those PCAP files and publishes to a [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) topic that can be subscribed to by any other process that wants to analyze that PCAP. In Malcolm (at the time of the [v{{ site.malcolm.version }} release]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/releases/tag/v{{ site.malcolm.version }})), there are three such ZeroMQ topics: the `zeek`, `suricata` and `arkime` containers. These actually share the [same script]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/shared/bin/pcap_processor.py) to run the PCAP through Zeek, Suricata, and Arkime, respectively. For an example to follow, the `zeek` container is the less complicated of the two. To integrate a new PCAP processing tool into Malcolm (named `cooltool` for this example) the process would entail:

1. Define the service as instructed in the [Adding a new service](contributing-new-image.md#NewImage) section
    * Note how the existing `zeek` and `arkime` services use [bind mounts](contributing-local-modifications.md#Bind) to access the local `./pcap` directory
1. Write a script (modelled after [the one]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/shared/bin/pcap_processor.py) `zeek`, `suricata`, and `arkime` use) that subscribes to the PCAP topic port (`30441` as defined in [pcap_utils.py]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/shared/bin/pcap_utils.py)) and handles the PCAP files published there, each PCAP file represented by a JSON dictionary with `name`, `tags`, `size`, `type` and `mime` keys (search for `FILE_INFO_` in [pcap_utils.py]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/shared/bin/pcap_utils.py)). This script should be added to and run by the `cooltool.Dockerfile`-generated container.
1. Add whatever other logic needed to get `cooltool`'s data into Malcolm, whether by writing it directly info OpenSearch or by sending log files for parsing and enrichment by [Logstash](contributing-logstash.md#Logstash) (especially see the section on [Parsing a new log data source](contributing-logstash.md#LogstashNewSource))

While that might be a bit of hand-waving, these general steps take care of the PCAP processing piece: users shouldn't have to really edit any *existing* code to add a new PCAP processor, only create a *new* container to subscribe to ZeroMQ topic and handle the PCAPs it receives.

The `PCAP_PIPELINE_VERBOSITY` [environment variables](malcolm-config.md#MalcolmConfigEnvVars) in `./config/upload-common.env` can be set to `-v`, `-vv`, etc., to increase the verbosity of debug logging from the output of the containers involved in the PCAP processing pipeline.
