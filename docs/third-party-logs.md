# Forwarding Third-Party Logs to Malcolm

Malcolm uses [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/index/) for data storage and search and visualization, and [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash/) for log processing. Because these tools are data agnostic, Malcolm can be configured to accept various host logs and other third-party logs sent from log forwaders such as [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) and [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/). Some examples of the types of logs these forwarders might send include:

* System resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.)
* System temperatures
* Linux system logs
* Windows event logs
* Process or service health status
* Logs appended to textual log files (e.g., `tail`-ing a log file)
* The output of an external script or program
* Messages in the form of MQTT control packets
* many more...

The types of third-party logs and metrics discussed in this document are *not* the same as the network session metadata provided by Arkime, Zeek, and Suricata. Please refer to the [Malcolm Contributor Guide](contributing-guide.md) for information on integrating a new network traffic analysis provider.

## <a name="Malcolm"></a>Configuring Malcolm

The environment variables in [`filebeat.env`](malcolm-config.md#MalcolmConfigEnvVars) for configuring how Malcolm accepts external logs are prefixed with `FILEBEAT_TCP_…`. These values can be specified during Malcolm configuration (i.e., when running [`./scripts/configure`](malcolm-config.md#ConfigAndTuning)), as can be seen from the following excerpt from the [Installation example](ubuntu-install-example.md#InstallationExample):

```
…
Expose Logstash port to external hosts? (y/N): y
…
Expose Filebeat TCP port to external hosts? (y/N): y
1: json
2: raw
Select log format for messages sent to Filebeat TCP listener (json): 1

Source field to parse for messages sent to Filebeat TCP listener (message): message

Target field under which to store decoded JSON fields for messages sent to Filebeat TCP listener (miscbeat): miscbeat

Field to drop from events sent to Filebeat TCP listener (message): message

Tag to apply to messages sent to Filebeat TCP listener (_malcolm_beats): _malcolm_beats
…
```

The variables corresponding to these questions can be found in [`filebeat.env`](malcolm-config.md#MalcolmConfigEnvVars):

* `FILEBEAT_TCP_LISTEN` - whether or not to expose a [Filebeat TCP input listener](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-tcp.html) to which logs may be sent (the default TCP port is `5045`: users may need to adjust firewall accordingly)
* `FILEBEAT_TCP_LOG_FORMAT` - log format expected for logs sent to the Filebeat TCP input listener (`json` or `raw`)
* `FILEBEAT_TCP_PARSE_SOURCE_FIELD` - source field name to parse (when `FILEBEAT_TCP_LOG_FORMAT` is `json`) for logs sent to the Filebeat TCP input listener
* `FILEBEAT_TCP_PARSE_TARGET_FIELD` - target field name to store decoded JSON fields (when `FILEBEAT_TCP_LOG_FORMAT` is `json`) for logs sent to the Filebeat TCP input listener
* `FILEBEAT_TCP_PARSE_DROP_FIELD` - name of field to drop (if it exists) in logs sent to the Filebeat TCP input listener
* `FILEBEAT_TCP_TAG` - tag to append to events sent to the Filebeat TCP input listener

These variables' values will depend on the forwarder and the format of the data it sends. Note that unless creating a custom [Logstash pipeline](contributing-logstash.md#LogstashNewSource), users probably want to choose the default `_malcolm_beats` for `FILEBEAT_TCP_TAG` in order for logs to be picked up and ingested through Malcolm's `beats` pipeline.

### <a name="MalcolmTLS"></a>Secure communication

In order to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data, Malcolm's default (set via the `BEATS_SSL` environment variable in [`beats-common.env`](malcolm-config.md#MalcolmConfigEnvVars)) is to require connections from external forwarders to be encrypted using TLS. When [`./scripts/auth_setup`](authsetup.md#AuthSetup) is run, self-signed certificates are generated which may be used by remote log forwarders. Located in the `filebeat/certs/` directory, the certificate authority and client certificate and key files should be copied to the host on which the forwarder is running and used when defining its settings for connecting to Malcolm.

## <a name="FluentBit"></a>Fluent Bit

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is a fast and lightweight logging and metrics processor and forwarder that works well with Malcolm. It is [well-documented](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual), supports a number of [platforms](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/getting-started-with-fluent-bit) including [Linux](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/linux), [Microsoft Windows](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/windows), macOS (either built [via source](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/macos) or installed with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/fluent-bit#default)) and more. It provides many [data sources](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs) (inputs).

### <a name="FluentBitBash"></a>Convenience Script for Linux/macOS

[`fluent-bit-setup.sh`]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/{{ site.github.build_revision }}/scripts/third-party-logs/fluent-bit-setup.sh) is a Bash script to help install and configure Fluent Bit on Linux and macOS systems. After configuring Malcolm to accept and parse forwarded logs as described above, run `fluent-bit-setup.sh` as illustrated in the examples below:

## <a name="Beats"></a>Beats

Elastic [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/beats/) can also be used to forward data to Malcolm's Filebeat TCP listener. Follow the [Get started with Beats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/getting-started.html) documentation for configuring Beats on a host system.

In contrast to Fluent Bit, Beats forwarders write to Malcolm's Logstash input over TCP port 5044 (rather than its Filebeat TCP input). Answer `Y` when prompted `Expose Logstash port to external hosts?` during Malcolm configuration (i.e., when running [`./scripts/configure`](malcolm-config.md#ConfigAndTuning)) to allow external remote Beats forwarders to send logs to Logstash.

The Beat's [configuration YML file](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/config-file-format.html) file might look something like this sample [winlogbeat.yml](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/configuring-howto-winlogbeat.html) file:


```yml
winlogbeat.event_logs:
  - name: Application
    ignore_older: 72h
  - name: System
  - name: Security
  - name: ForwardedEvents
    tags: [forwarded]
  - name: Windows PowerShell
    event_id: 400, 403, 600, 800
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
    event_id: 4103, 4104, 4105, 4106

processors:
  - add_tags:
      tags: [_malcolm_beats]

output.logstash:
  hosts: ["172.16.0.20:5044"]
  ssl.enabled: true
  ssl.certificate_authorities: ["/home/user/Malcolm/filebeat/certs/ca.crt"]
  ssl.certificate: "/home/user/Malcolm/filebeat/certs/client.crt"
  ssl.key: "/home/user/Malcolm/filebeat/certs/client.key"
  ssl.supported_protocols: "TLSv1.2"
  ssl.verification_mode: "none"
```

The important bits to note in this example are the settings under [`output.logstash`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/logstash-output.html) (including the TLS-related files described above in **Configuring Malcolm**) and the `_malcolm_beats` value in [`tags`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/add-tags.html): unless creating a custom [Logstash pipeline](contributing-logstash.md#LogstashNewSource), users probably want to use `_malcolm_beats` in order for logs to be picked up and ingested through Malcolm's `beats` pipeline. This applies regardless of the specific Beats forwarder being used (e.g., Filebeat, Metricbeat, Winlogbeat, etc.).

Most Beats forwarders can use [processors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/defining-processors.html) to filter, transform, and enhance data prior to sending it to Malcolm. Consult each forwarder's [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/beats/) to learn more about what processors are available and how to configure them. Use the [Console output](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/console-output.html) for debugging and experimenting with how Beats forwarders format the logs they generate.

## <a name="Syslog"></a>Syslog

Malcolm can accept [syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) messages directly. During [configuration](malcolm-hedgehog-e2e-iso-install.md#MalcolmConfig), select **customize** when prompted **Should Malcolm accept logs and metrics from a Hedgehog Linux sensor or other forwarder?** to specify whether Malcolm should accept syslog over TCP, UDP, or both, and the respective ports on which the messages should be accepted.

Other options for configuring how Malcolm accepts and processes syslog messages can be configured via environment variables in [`filebeat.env`](malcolm-config.md#MalcolmConfigEnvVars).


### <a name="SyslogISOFirewall"></a>ISO-installed Desktop Environment Firewall

If Malcolm is running in an instance installed via the [Malcolm installer ISO](malcolm-iso.md#ISO), the system's software firewall needs to be manually updated to open the port(s) for Syslog messages. This can be performed via the command line inside a terminal on the Malcolm system, using the port(s) specified during the configuration mentioned above. For example:

```bash
$ sudo ufw allow 514/tcp
Rule added
$ sudo ufw allow 514/udp
Rule added
```

## <a name="ThirdPartyUpload"></a>Uploading Third-Party Logs

### Microsoft Windows Event Logs

Microsoft Windows [event log files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-log-file-format) (with a `.evtx` file extension) can also be [uploaded](upload.md#Upload) via the artifact upload interface, either singly or in archive files (`application/gzip`, `application/x-gzip`, `application/x-7z-compressed`, `application/x-bzip2`, `application/x-cpio`, `application/x-lzip`, `application/x-lzma`, `application/x-rar-compressed`, `application/x-tar`, `application/x-xz`, or `application/zip`). These files are processed using [evtx](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx) and indexed as similarly as possible to the way forwarded Windows event logs are indexed.

## <a name="Data"></a>Data Format and Visualization

Because Malcolm could receive logs or metrics from virtually any provider, Malcolm most likely does not have prebuilt dashboards and visualizations for third-party logs. Luckily, [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/index/) provides visualization tools that can be used with whatever data is stored in Malcolm's OpenSearch document store. Here are some resources covering OpenSearch Dashboards and building custom visualizations:

* [OpenSearch Dashboards](dashboards.md) in the Malcolm documentation
* [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/index/) documentation
* [Kibana User Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.10/index.html) (OpenSearch Dashboards is an open-source fork of Kibana, so much of its documentation also applies to OpenSearch Dashboards)

* [Search Queries in Arkime and OpenSearch](queries-cheat-sheet.md#SearchCheatSheet)

## <a name="Indices"></a>Document Indices

Third-party logs ingested into Malcolm as outlined in this document will be indexed into the `malcolm_beats_*` index pattern (unless a user has created their own [Logstash pipeline](contributing-logstash.md#LogstashNewSource)), which can be selected in the OpenSearch Dashboards' Discover view or when specifying the log source for a new visualization.

Because these documents are indexed by OpenSearch dynamically as they are ingested by Logstash, their component fields will not show up as searchable in OpenSearch Dashboards visualizations until its copy of the field list is refreshed. Malcolm periodically refreshes this list, but if fields are missing from visualizations, users may wish to do it manually.

Once Malcolm has ingested a new log type it has not seen before, users can manually refresh OpenSearch Dashboards's field list by clicking **Management** → **Index Patterns**, then selecting the index pattern (`malcolm_beats_*`) and clicking the reload **🗘** button near the upper-right of the window.
