# <a name="InstallationExample"></a>Installation example using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Here's a step-by-step example of getting [Malcolm from GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/{{ site.github.build_revision }}), configuring the local system and the Malcolm instance, and running it on a system running Ubuntu Linux. Installing Malcolm may require some variation depending on individual system configuration, but this should be a good starting point.

For a more in-depth guide convering installing both Malcolm and a [Hedgehog Linux](hedgehog.md) sensor using the [Malcolm installer ISO](malcolm-iso.md#ISO) and [Hedgehog Linux installer ISO](hedgehog-installation.md#HedgehogInstallation), see **[End-to-end Malcolm and Hedgehog Linux ISO Installation](malcolm-hedgehog-e2e-iso-install.md#InstallationExample)**.

The commands in this example should be executed as a non-root user.

Use `git` to clone Malcolm into a local working copy, or download and extract the artifacts from the [latest release]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/releases/latest).

To install Malcolm from the latest Malcolm release, browse to the [Malcolm releases page on GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/releases/latest) and download at a minimum the files ending in `.py` and the `malcolm_YYYYMMDD_HHNNSS_xxxxxxx.tar.gz` file, then navigate to the downloads directory:
```
user@host:~$ cd Downloads/
user@host:~/Downloads$ ls
malcolm_common.py malcolm_kubernetes.py malcolm_utils.py install.py  malcolm_20190611_095410_ce2d8de.tar.gz
```

If obtaining Malcolm using `git` instead, run the following command to clone Malcolm into a local working copy:
```
user@host:~$ git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}
Cloning into 'Malcolm'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (81/81), done.

user@host:~$ cd Malcolm/
```

Next, run the `install.py` script to configure the system. Replace `user` in this example with the local account username, and follow the prompts. Most questions have acceptable defaults that can be accepted by pressing the `Enter` key. Depending on whether Malcolm is being installed from the release tarball or inside of a git working copy, the questions below will be slightly different, but for the most part are the same.
```

```

If Malcolm is being configured from within a git working copy, `install.py` will now exit. Run `./scripts/configure` to continue with configuration:
```
user@host:~/Malcolm$ ./scripts/configure
```

Alternately, if Malcolm is being installed from the release tarball, the script will ask whether the user would like to extract the contents of the tarball and to specify the installation directory and Malcolm configuration will continue:
```
Extract Malcolm runtime files from /home/user/Downloads/malcolm_20190611_095410_ce2d8de.tar.gz (Y / n): y

Enter installation path for Malcolm [/home/user/Downloads/malcolm]: /home/user/Malcolm
Malcolm runtime files extracted to /home/user/Malcolm
```

Now that any necessary system configuration changes have been made, the local Malcolm instance will be configured:
```

Malcolm has been installed to /home/user/Malcolm. See README.md for more information.
Scripts for starting and stopping Malcolm and changing authentication-related settings can be found in /home/user/Malcolm/scripts.
```

At this point it is recommended to **reboot the system** so that the new system settings can be applied. After rebooting, log back in and return to the directory to which Malcolm was installed (or to which the git working copy was cloned).

The next step is to [set up authentication](authsetup.md#AuthSetup) and generate some unique self-signed TLS certificates. Users may choose another username instead of `analyst` to log in to the Malcolm web interface.
```
user@host:~/Malcolm$ ./scripts/auth_setup 

Store administrator username/password for local Malcolm access? (Y / n): y

Administrator username: analyst
analyst password:
analyst password (again):

Additional local accounts can be created at https://localhost/auth/ when Malcolm is running

(Re)generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS access (Y / n): y 

(Re)generate self-signed certificates for a remote log forwarder (Y / n): y

Configure remote primary or secondary OpenSearch/Elasticsearch instance? (y / N): n

Store username/password for OpenSearch Alerting email sender account? (y / N): n

(Re)generate internal passwords for NetBox (Y / n): y
```

Users planning to install and configure sensor devices running [Hedgehog Linux](hedgehog.md) must perform an additional step to allow communication between a Malcolm instance and an installation of Hedgehog Linux. In order for a sensor running Hedgehog Linux to securely communicate with Malcolm, it needs a copy of the client certificates generated when "(Re)generate self-signed certificates for a remote log forwarder" was selected above. The certificate authority, certificate, and key files to be copied to and used by the remote log forwarder are located in Malcolm's `filebeat/certs/` directory; these certificates should be copied to the `/opt/sensor/sensor_ctl/logstash-client-certificates` directory on the Hedgehog Linux sensor.

As an alternative to manually copying the files to the sensor, Malcolm can facilitate the secure transfer of these certificates using [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc), an open-source tool for secure file transfer between two computers. Malcolm does not automatically download and install `croc`, but it may be downloaded from its [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases) or [installed from the command line](https://github.com/schollz/croc#install). If `croc` exists in the `PATH` on the Malcolm system, the `auth_setup` script will prompt to "Transfer self-signed client certificates to a remote log forwarder." Users can follow the steps outlined in the **[End-to-end Malcolm and Hedgehog Linux ISO Installation](malcolm-hedgehog-e2e-iso-install.md#InstallationExample)** (see [the Malcolm portion](malcolm-hedgehog-e2e-iso-install.md#MalcolmAuthSetup) and [the sensor portion](malcolm-hedgehog-e2e-iso-install.md##HedgehogGetCerts) of those instructions) to copy the certificates to the sensor.

In this example, rather than [building Malcolm from scratch](development.md#Build), images may be pulled from [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/idaholab/packages?repo_name=Malcolm):

Finally, start Malcolm. When Malcolm starts it will stream informational and debug messages to the console until it has completed initializing.

```

It will take several minutes for all of Malcolm's components to start up. Logstash will take the longest, probably 3 to 5 minutes. Users will know Logstash is fully ready when you see Logstash spit out a bunch of starting up messages, ending with this:
```
