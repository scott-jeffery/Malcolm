# Used in various services to define the connection to the OpenSearch document store.
# 'opensearch-local' indicates that Malcolm will maintain its own OpenSearch instance as its
#   primary data store. Set to 'opensearch-remote' or 'elasticsearch-remote' if you're
#   connecting to another cluster, in which case the other environment variables
#   in this section must also be set with the connection parameters.
OPENSEARCH_PRIMARY=opensearch-local
# URL for connecting to OpenSearch instance. When using Malcolm's internal instance
#   of OpenSearch (i.e., OPENSEARCH_PRIMARY is 'opensearch-local') this should be
#   'http://opensearch:9200', otherwise specify the primary remote instance URL
#   in the format 'protocol://host:port'.
OPENSEARCH_URL=http://opensearch:9200
# Used when OPENSEARCH_PRIMARY is 'opensearch-remote' or 'elasticsearch-remote',
#   the cURL-formatted config file contains login credentials for the primary
#   OpenSearch instance. It can be generated for you by the ./scripts/auth_setup script.
#   The notable parameters expected from this file would be user (with a "user:password"
#   value) and "insecure" (if the certificate verification setting below is 'false').
#   See cURL config file format at https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/configfile.
